The RTE3-ITA dataset is the German translation of the Textual Entailment English dataset used in the RTE-3 Challenge (http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/Challenges/RTE3/Datasets/).

Like its English counterpart, the German RTE-3 dataset is composed of a development set and a test set, each containing 800 T/H pairs. RTE3-DE has the following characteristics:
- all T/H pairs were translated into German by a native German speaker with and proofread by one other native German speaker, both with strong background in CL and NLP
- all information related to the English T/H pairs (e.g. length of T, task)  was imported into the German dataset 
- based on the the judgment of the Italian RTE3 Version, we have identified 5 (of the 15 Italian) pairs whose judgment is in disagreement with respect to English set. In the RTE3-DE dataset, the following T/H pairs have a different entailment judgment with respect to the corresponding English ones:
  * DEV SET: IDs 388, 549, 658, 663
  * TEST SET: IDs 663

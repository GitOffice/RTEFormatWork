* Possible (meaningful) Entailment edges from WP2 data 

- Pick inter-fragment edges only (including intra-interaction) 
- Pick inter-interaction edges only. 
** DONE easy way to distinguish fragment / interaction? 
- ALMA data looks okay. (ids are all interactionid_fragid_nodeid)  
- NICE data also looks the same. 
- [interactionid]_[fragmen_id]_[sentenceid] 




* Ruby sketch of the code 

** DONE read and gather inter-fragment edges
** TODO ... and non-edges

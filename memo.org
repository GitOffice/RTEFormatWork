* Possible (more meaningful) Entailment edges. 

- Pick inter-fragment edges only (including intra-interaction) 
- Pick inter-interaction edges only. 

** TODO easy way to distinguish fragment / interaction? 
- ALMA data looks okay. (ids are all interactionid_fragid_nodeid)  
- NICE data also looks the same. 
- [interactionid]_[fragmen_id]_[sentenceid]
